# spring-context-xml

This example illustrates the process of defining and loading a Spring context from an XML file. In this approach, the
configuration details for beans are specified in an XML file, typically named `applicationContext.xml`. The XML file
contains `<bean>` elements, each defining a specific bean along with its configurations.

To load the Spring context, the application uses `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. This class allows the loading of
XML-based configurations from the classpath. This XML-based approach provides a declarative way to configure the Spring
context, separating configuration details from application logic.
