# Spring Cloud Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway is a dynamic, lightweight, and powerful library that enables developers to build cloud-native
microservices and handle API requests efficiently. It provides a flexible, non-blocking, and customizable gateway for
routing, filtering, and load balancing of HTTP requests. Spring Cloud Gateway is a key component of the Spring Cloud
ecosystem and is often used for building scalable, resilient, and API-driven applications.

This module contains basic example of Spring Cloud Gateway usage with yaml mapping.

Examples forward requests to https://httpbin.org/ to get some sample responses.

Curl examples are stored in the comments in the application.yml.

## Overview

Spring Cloud Gateway offers a range of features and concepts that make it a versatile and critical component for
cloud-native applications:

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Routing:** Spring Cloud Gateway allows developers to define routes dynamically, enabling the routing of
  incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on conditions and criteria.

- **Filtering:** It offers a set of built-in filters and supports custom filter creation, allowing developers to apply
  transformations, validations, and other processing to requests and responses.

- **Load Balancing:** Spring Cloud Gateway can distribute requests across multiple instances of a microservice,
  promoting load balancing and high availability.

- **Circuit Breaking:** The library supports circuit-breaking patterns to manage failures and ensure resilience in
  microservices.

- **Path Rewriting:** Developers can rewrite paths in requests, making it possible to expose services via a consistent
  URL structure.

- **Security:** Spring Cloud Gateway can integrate with security protocols and mechanisms to protect API endpoints and
  ensure secure communication.

### Routing Configuration

- Routes are defined using a simple, expressive DSL (Domain-Specific Language) with conditions based on HTTP methods,
  paths, headers, and more.

- Spring Cloud Gateway supports both static and dynamic routing configurations, which can be loaded from a variety of
  sources, including properties files, environment variables, and databases.

### Integration with Spring Cloud

- Spring Cloud Gateway is an integral part of the Spring Cloud ecosystem and can be used in conjunction with other
  Spring Cloud components such as Eureka, Consul, and more.

### Customization

- Developers can create custom predicates and filters to tailor Spring Cloud Gateway to the specific needs of their
  applications.

Spring Cloud Gateway is designed for building scalable, resilient, and API-driven microservices. It is well-suited for
applications in which flexibility, adaptability, and performance are critical requirements.
