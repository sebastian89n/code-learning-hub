# üß† The Pragmatic Programmer ‚Äì Developer Cheat Sheet

## üß± Core Philosophy

| Principle            | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pragmatism**       | Use practical judgment. Adapt to the situation; don‚Äôt just follow rules blindly. |
| **Craftsmanship**    | Take pride in your work; strive for mastery. Treat programming as a skilled craft. |
| **Responsibility**   | Own your code. Don‚Äôt blame tools or others. ‚ÄúYour code, your problem.‚Äù   |
| **Communication**    | Clear code, clear comments, clear conversations. Everything is communication. |

## üîÅ Development Practices

| Principle                  | Why It Matters                              | How to Apply                                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)** | Duplication creates bugs and inefficiencies.   | Centralize logic, config, documentation. Abstract smartly.    |
| **Orthogonality**          | Independent components = less risk, easier maintenance. | Decouple modules, services, and concerns.                     |
| **Tracer Bullets**         | Validate direction early.                   | Build thin vertical slices (not isolated modules).            |
| **Prototypes & Spike Solutions** | Explore risky ideas safely.                  | Use for UI/tech exploration. Throw away after learning.       |
| **Refactor Mercilessly**   | Bad code compounds over time.               | Clean as you go. Use tests to stay safe.                      |
| **Version Control Everything** | History saves your sanity.                  | Source, docs, configs ‚Äî use Git and commit often.             |

## üö® Code Quality & Design

| Principle                        | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Don‚Äôt Live with Broken Windows** | Fix small issues fast to avoid decay. Don‚Äôt tolerate messy code.         |
| **Design by Contract**           | Define clear expectations (preconditions/postconditions) for functions. |
| **Tell, Don‚Äôt Ask**              | Objects should do the work, not expose internals. (OO design principle.) |
| **Prefer Composition Over Inheritance** | Keeps systems flexible and avoids tight coupling.                  |
| **Program Close to the Problem Domain** | Use domain language in your code (Domain-Driven Design lite).       |

## üîê Robustness & Error Handling

| Practice                    | Summary                                                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fail Fast**              | Catch problems early before they cause big issues.                       |
| **Graceful Degradation**   | App should still function partially if something fails.                  |
| **Use Exceptions Intentionally** | Don‚Äôt overuse exceptions. Use them for truly exceptional situations. |
| **Don‚Äôt Ignore Errors**    | Every error ignored is a future bug. Handle or log explicitly.           |

## üß™ Testing & Validation

| Principle                          | Summary                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Early, Test Often**         | The sooner you catch bugs, the cheaper they are.                          |
| **Automate Testing**               | Use unit tests, integration tests, and continuous testing pipelines.      |
| **Use Assertions to Check Assumptions** | Useful in both code and design. Fail fast if assumptions break.    |
| **Don‚Äôt Rely on QA to Find Bugs**  | QA exists to verify, not babysit your code.                               |

## üß∞ Tooling & Automation

| Best Practices              | Summary                                                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Know Your Tools**        | Master your IDE, terminal, debugger, profiler, etc.               |
| **Automate Boring Stuff**  | Repetitive = fragile. Automate builds, deployments, scripts.       |
| **Use Shell Scripting Wisely** | Your shell is a superpower for small tasks.                      |
| **Write Tools When Needed**| Don‚Äôt be afraid to build internal tools to save time.              |

## üìö Learning & Growth

| Principle                    | Summary                                                                        |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Invest Regularly in Learning** | Allocate time to learn new languages, frameworks, or techniques.       |
| **Learn a New Language Yearly**  | Broaden your thinking (e.g., try functional, scripting, or low-level). |
| **Read Code**                | Learn from open source or peers. Reading code improves writing code.         |
| **Stay Curious**             | Keep asking why things work the way they do. Explore source code and internals. |
