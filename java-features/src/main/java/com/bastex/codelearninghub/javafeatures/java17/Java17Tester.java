        // Java 12 - Language-wise Switch Expressions were introduced as a preview feature, we got two G1 improvements(1, 2),
        // and a new experimental low-pause garbage collector â€“ Shenandoah.

        // Java 13 - Switch Expressions were refined, Text Blocks got introduced as a preview feature, and Socket API reimplemented.
        // Additionally, we got Linux/AArch64 support for ZGC.

        // Java 14 had quite a few interesting additions:
        //
        // - Pattern Matching for instanceof (preview)
        // - JFR Event Streaming
        // - Records (preview)
        // - Helpful NullPointerExceptions with extra hints about what caused it
        // - Switch Expressions get promoted to standard
        // - and CMS garbage collector permanently removed

        // Java 15 is already out and has brought a few interesting additions:
        //
        //- Nashorn and biased locking removed
        //- Text Blocks, ZGC and Shenandoah GC promoted to standard features
        //- Sealed(Preview) and Hidden classes added
        //- DatagramSocket API reimplemented
        // As well as second previews of:
        //
        // - Records
        // - Pattern Matching for instanceof
        // - And the second incubator release of Foreign Memory Access API!
