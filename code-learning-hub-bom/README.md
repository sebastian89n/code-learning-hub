# BOM

A Maven BOM, or "Bill of Materials," is a specialized artifact used in the Apache Maven build system and in other build
automation tools. Its primary purpose is to manage and centralize dependency version information for a group of related
projects within a software ecosystem. Here's a more detailed description of what a Maven BOM is and how it is used:

#### Dependency Management:

A Maven BOM is essentially a POM (Project Object Model) file that contains a list of dependencies along with their
corresponding versions. It acts as a central reference point for version information, making it easier to maintain and
control dependencies across multiple projects in a consistent manner.

#### Centralization:

Instead of specifying the version of each dependency in every individual project's POM file, developers can declare
these dependencies in the BOM. This centralizes version management and reduces redundancy, making it easier to ensure
that all related projects use compatible library versions.

#### Simplified Version Updates:

When a new version of a library is released, you can update the version in the BOM, and all projects that reference the
BOM will inherit the new version automatically. This simplifies the process of keeping libraries up-to-date and ensures
consistency across projects.

#### Grouping Dependencies:

A BOM can group related dependencies for a particular purpose or domain. For example, you can have a BOM for a
microservices architecture, a BOM for a web application stack, or a BOM for a particular set of utility libraries. This
helps organize and manage dependencies more efficiently.

#### Reduced Conflicts:

By ensuring that all projects reference the same version of a dependency through the BOM, you reduce the chances of
version conflicts that can arise when different projects specify different versions of the same library.

#### Easy Integration:

BOMs are widely used in Maven-based ecosystems, and they integrate seamlessly with popular build tools and repositories.
This makes it easier for developers to incorporate them into their projects.

In summary, a Maven BOM is a valuable tool for managing dependencies and their versions in a consistent and efficient
manner across multiple projects within a software ecosystem. It simplifies dependency management, reduces potential
conflicts, and streamlines the process of keeping libraries up-to-date, making it an essential component in modern
software development workflows.

BOM provides the flexibility to add a dependency to our module without worrying about the version that we should depend
on.

BOM can be inherited as a parent, in which case we inherit both dependencyManagement and pluginManagement sections.

e.g.

    <parent>
        <groupId>com.bastex</groupId>
        <artifactId>code-learning-hub-bom</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath>code-learning-hub-bom/pom.xml</relativePath>
    </parent>

Or it can be imported, in which case we transfer only dependencyManagement section:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.bastex</groupId>
        <artifactId>code-learning-hub-bom</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>>
