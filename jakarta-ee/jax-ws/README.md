# JAX-WS: Jakarta XML Web Services

JAX-WS, or Jakarta XML Web Services(previously Java API for XML Web Services), is a Java-based technology for building
and consuming web services using
XML-based messaging. It provides a standardized approach to developing both SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).

## Modules

- **jax-ws-client** - JAX-WS client for the jax-ws-server module. It uses classes auto-generated by maven plugin from
  WSDL to connect to
  the server.


- **jax-ws-server** - example of JAX-WS web service. Done with Bottom-Up(Contract-Last) approach. WSDL is generated
  from the classes.

## Overview

JAX-WS simplifies the creation of web services by allowing Java developers to define web service endpoints using
annotations. These endpoints can be exposed over HTTP, enabling communication between different applications and
services. JAX-WS supports both contract-first and code-first development approaches for web services.

## Common Annotations

JAX-WS uses a set of annotations to define web service endpoints and configure various aspects of web service behavior.
Some of the most common annotations include:

1. `@WebService`: Marks a class as a web service endpoint. It provides information such as the service name, port name,
   and target namespace for the web service.

2. `@WebMethod`: Specifies that a method in a web service endpoint class is a web service operation. It allows
   customization of the operation name and other attributes.

3. `@WebParam`: Defines the parameters for a web service operation. It allows specifying the name, mode (input, output),
   and other details of parameters.

4. `@WebResult`: Specifies the return value of a web service operation. It allows customizing the name, part name, and
   other attributes of the result.

5. `@WebFault`: Indicates an exception as a web service fault. It allows specifying the name and target namespace of the
   fault.

6. `@WebEndpoint`: Marks a field or property as a web service endpoint reference. It can be used to customize the name
   and address of the endpoint reference.

7. `@WebServiceClient`: Provides information about a web service client, including the service name, WSDL location, and
   endpoint address.

These annotations help in defining and customizing web service endpoints and their operations, making it easier to
create, deploy, and consume web services in Java using JAX-WS.

## Bottom-Up and Top-Down in JAX-WS Development

In JAX-WS development, the "Bottom-Up" approach starts with creating web service using Java classes and annotations.
Later WSDL is generated from the code.

"Top-Down" approach begins with defining WSDL and XSD and later Java code with annotations is generated from those
files.
