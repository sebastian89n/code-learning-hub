    <h1>Servlets Summary</h1>
    <p>Servelets are Java-based components that are used for building web applications. They run on the server-side and
        handle client requests and generate dynamic web content.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Servlet:</strong> A Java class that extends the `javax.servlet.HttpServlet` class and is responsible
            for processing HTTP requests and generating HTTP responses.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Servlet Container:</strong> A web server or application server that manages the lifecycle of
            servlets, including their initialization, execution, and destruction.
        </li>
        <li><strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> Servlets can handle various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
            etc., by implementing specific methods (e.g., `doGet`, `doPost`) to handle each method.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Request and Response Objects:</strong> Servlets interact with the client's request through the
            `HttpServletRequest` object and generate responses using the `HttpServletResponse` object.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Servlet Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>A servlet goes through the following lifecycle stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Servlet is loaded and initialized by the container.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Handling:</strong> Servlet processes client requests by implementing HTTP methods like
            `doGet` and `doPost`.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Response Generation:</strong> Servlet generates dynamic content and constructs an HTTP response.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Destruction:</strong> Servlet is removed from memory by the container.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Servlet Configuration</h2>
    <p>Servlets are configured using annotations or the `web.xml` deployment descriptor. Configuration includes URL
        mappings and initialization parameters.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>Servlets are used for various purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling user authentication and session management.</li>
        <li>Processing form data and handling user input.</li>
        <li>Generating dynamic web content and serving HTML, XML, JSON, etc.</li>
        <li>Implementing RESTful web services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>Servlets should be used with security best practices in mind, such as input validation, secure authentication,
        and protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery
        (CSRF).</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Servlets are a fundamental technology for building dynamic and interactive web applications in Java. They provide
        a way to handle HTTP requests and generate customized responses, making them a key component in modern web
        development.</p>
