# Jakarta XML Binding

Jakarta XML Binding (JAXB) is a Java technology that simplifies the conversion of XML data to Java
objects (unmarshalling) and Java objects to XML data (marshalling). It provides a standardized way to work with XML data
in Java applications.

## Overview

JAXB allows developers to map Java classes to XML schemas and vice versa. It provides a set of annotations for
customizing the mapping and controlling how Java objects are serialized to XML and deserialized from XML. JAXB is
commonly used in applications that need to interact with XML-based data sources or produce XML responses, such as web
services.

## Common Annotations

JAXB uses annotations to define how Java classes are mapped to XML elements and attributes. Some of the most common
annotations include:

1. `@XmlRootElement`: Marks a Java class as the root element for XML representation. It defines the XML element that
   encapsulates an instance of the class when marshalled to XML.

2. `@XmlElement`: Specifies the mapping of a Java class field or property to an XML element. It allows customization of
   the XML element name, namespace, and more.

3. `@XmlAttribute`: Maps a Java field or property to an XML attribute. It indicates that the associated value should be
   represented as an attribute within the XML element.

4. `@XmlType`: Defines the XML type for a Java class. It allows specifying a name for the XML type and its namespace.

5. `@XmlTransient`: Excludes a Java field or property from XML binding, indicating that it should not be included in the
   XML representation.

6. `@XmlAccessorType`: Controls the access type for fields or properties within a class. It can be set to `FIELD` (
   default) or `PROPERTY`.

7. `@XmlAccessorOrder`: Specifies the order in which fields or properties are marshalled to XML. It can be set
   to `ALPHABETICAL` (default) or `UNDEFINED`.

These annotations help developers define how Java objects correspond to XML data, offering fine-grained control over the
mapping process. JAXB simplifies the integration of XML data in Java applications and is widely used in various domains.
