# Git Tutorial

## Section 1: Core Concepts

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes to their code, collaborate with others,
and manage project history. It provides a way to save different versions of your code, making it easy to work on new
features or fix issues without breaking the existing codebase.

### Version Control

Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to files over time. It allows you to:

- **Track Changes:** See what changes were made, who made them, and when.
- **Collaborate:** Work with others on the same project and merge changes seamlessly.
- **Revert Changes:** Go back to a previous state of your project.
- **Maintain History:** Keep a detailed history of all changes made to your code.

### Git Terminology

Before diving into Git commands, let's understand some essential terms:

- **Repository (Repo):** A repository is like a project's folder. It contains all your project's files and their
  history.

- **Commit:** A commit is a snapshot of the changes you've made to your code. It's like saving a checkpoint in your
  project's history.

- **HEAD:** Head is a reference to the most recent commit in the current branch.

- **Branch:** A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. You can create branches to work on new
  features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

- **Remote:** A remote is a copy of your repository stored on a server, often on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.

- **Pull Request (PR):** A pull request is a way to propose changes from your branch to the main project. It's commonly
  used in collaborative workflows.

- **Merge:** Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.

### Why Use Git?

Git offers several advantages:

- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.

- **History Tracking:** You can track changes over time, providing transparency and accountability.

- **Branching:** Create branches to experiment with new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.

- **Remote Repositories:** Store your code on remote servers for backup and collaboration.

- **Open Source:** Git is open source and widely used, with extensive documentation and community support.
