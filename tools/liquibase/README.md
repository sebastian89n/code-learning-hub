Example of Liquibase scripts and code to execute them programmatically via separate jar.

Liquibase is an open-source database schema change management solution which enables you to manage revisions of your
database changes easily. Liquibase makes it easy for anyone involved in the application release process to:

- Eliminate errors and delays when releasing databases.


- Deploy and roll back changes for specific versions without needing to know what has already been deployed.


- Deploy database and application changes together, so they always stay in sync.
