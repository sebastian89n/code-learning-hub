# PlantUML Summary

PlantUML is a powerful tool for creating diagrams in a simple, text-based format. It's widely used in software
development and other fields to visualize and communicate complex concepts and systems.

## How to Use PlantUML

1. **Install PlantUML:**
    - PlantUML can be used offline with a locally installed tool or online via various web-based editors.

2. **Create a Diagram:**
    - Choose the type of diagram you want to create, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, etc.

3. **Write Diagram Description:**
    - Use the PlantUML syntax to describe the elements and relationships in your diagram. For example:

   ```plantuml
   @startuml
   class Car {
     + make: string
     + model: string
     + start()
     + stop()
   }
   @enduml
   ```

4. **Render the Diagram:**
    - Use a PlantUML renderer or editor to visualize your diagram. You can copy the PlantUML code into these tools to
      generate the diagram.

## Common Diagram Types

1. **Class Diagrams**: Represent classes and their relationships with attributes and methods.
2. **Sequence Diagrams**: Show interactions between objects over time.
3. **Use Case Diagrams**: Illustrate the interactions between actors and a system.
4. **Activity Diagrams**: Depict workflows and processes with various activities and decisions.
5. **Component Diagrams**: Display system components and their connections.
6. **State Diagrams**: Describe the behavior of a single object or system.
7. **Deployment Diagrams**: Illustrate the physical deployment of components in a system.

## Customization
