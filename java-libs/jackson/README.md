# jackson

Project contains examples of mapping Java POJO's to jsons, custom serializers/deserializer, configuring parsing with
inheritance, configuring ObjectMappers,
using different data types etc.

In the project there's an example of Json and XML.

To use other data types add dependency to correct jackson-dataformat-{type} and configure ObjectMapper with correct
factory.
