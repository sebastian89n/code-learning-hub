# Jackson: Java Library for JSON Processing

Jackson is a widely-used Java library for handling JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. It provides a powerful and
efficient way to parse, generate, and manipulate JSON data within Java applications. Jackson is commonly used for tasks
such as deserialization and serialization of JSON data, making it an essential tool for web services, data exchange, and
configuration management.

## Overview

Jackson offers two main components: the Streaming API and the Data Binding API, both of which enable developers to work
with JSON data efficiently.

### Streaming API

The Streaming API is a low-level approach that allows you to process JSON data incrementally. It's useful for situations
where you need to read or write JSON data without loading the entire document into memory. Key classes in the Streaming
API include:

- `JsonParser`: Reads JSON data as a stream of tokens, making it memory-efficient and suitable for large datasets.
- `JsonGenerator`: Writes JSON data as a stream, enabling you to create JSON documents incrementally.

### Data Binding API

The Data Binding API is a high-level approach that simplifies the mapping of Java objects to JSON and vice versa. It
offers seamless conversion between Java objects and JSON data. Jackson relies on a set of annotations to control the
mapping process. Some of the most common annotations include:

- `@JsonProperty`: Maps a Java class field or method to a specific JSON property, allowing you to customize the JSON
  key.
- `@JsonFormat`: Configures the format of date and time values during serialization and deserialization.
- `@JsonIgnore`: Excludes a Java class field or method from JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `@JsonInclude`: Controls the inclusion of properties with null or default values in the JSON output.
- `@JsonCreator`: Annotates a constructor or factory method to indicate how to create instances during deserialization.
- `@JsonAnyGetter` and `@JsonAnySetter`: Allow dynamic handling of properties not explicitly mapped to Java class
  fields.
- `@JsonSubTypes` and `@JsonTypeInfo`: Support polymorphic type handling in JSON data.

Jackson's Data Binding API simplifies the process of converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa, providing a
seamless integration between Java and JSON data.

## Common Use Cases

Jackson is used in a variety of scenarios, including:

- Deserialization of JSON data from HTTP requests in web services.
- Serialization of Java objects to JSON for data storage or transport.
- Configuration management, especially in applications that use JSON-based configuration files.
- Data exchange and interoperability between systems that communicate with JSON.

Jackson's versatility, performance, and ease of use make it a preferred choice for JSON processing in the Java
ecosystem.
