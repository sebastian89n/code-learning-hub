# MapStruct: Java Bean Mapping Made Easy

MapStruct is a Java-based code generation tool that simplifies the process of mapping data between Java bean types. It
automates the generation of mapping code, eliminating the need for writing boilerplate code to transform one bean into
another. MapStruct is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to convert data objects between different layers
of an application, such as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and entity classes.

## Overview

MapStruct offers a powerful and efficient solution for mapping between Java bean types, and it provides a wide range of
features and annotations to streamline the mapping process. Some of the key concepts and features include:

### Annotations

- **`@Mapper`:** The `@Mapper` annotation is used to define an interface as a mapping interface. It identifies the class
  as a source of mapping logic and specifies the target component model.

- **`@Mapping`:** The `@Mapping` annotation allows you to configure individual mappings between source and target
  properties. You can specify source and target property names, target property type, and more. MapStruct automatically
  generates the code to perform these mappings.

- **`@InheritInverseConfiguration`:** This annotation helps inverting the mapping logic. It indicates that the inverse
  mapping should be the reverse of the annotated mapping method.

### Mapping Strategies

MapStruct supports different mapping strategies, such as:

- **Component Model:** You can specify the component model for the generated mapper, including `default`, `spring`, and
  others. The component model influences the type of code generated and how the mapper is used.

### Custom Mappings

- While MapStruct generates most of the mapping code automatically, you can provide custom mapping methods within
  the `@Mapper` interface to handle complex or non-standard mappings.

### Null Value Handling

- MapStruct provides options for handling null values during mapping. You can specify how null source properties should
  be handled in the target object.

### Reporting

- MapStruct offers detailed error reports and helpful messages during compilation, making it easier to identify and
  address mapping issues.

### Integration

- MapStruct can be integrated with various build tools and IDEs, such as Maven, Gradle, and popular IDEs like IntelliJ
  IDEA and Eclipse.

MapStruct is an excellent choice for projects where data mapping between Java bean types is a common task. It helps
reduce code duplication and ensures that mapping code is efficient and error-free. By generating the mapping code,
MapStruct makes your codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
